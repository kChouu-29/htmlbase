        <h1 style="color: pink;">An Insider's Guide to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week." taget="_blank">NYFW</a></h1>

        <p>NYFW can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, especially if you’ve never been. <br>
            Luckily,I’m here to give you an insider’s guide and make your first show a pleasurable experience.<br>
            By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut, you’ll have an unforgettable experience!</p>
        <h2 style="color: chocolate;">Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>
        <p>If you’re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag.<br>
             But I wasn’t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I’m here to help you out.<br> 
             First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET.<br> 
             If you’re worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won’t have fun. <br>
             Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most.<br>
             Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>
        <h2 style="color: chartreuse;">Dressing for the Show</h2>
        <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don’t you’ll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. <br>
            Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. <br>
            Also it’s important to wear shoes you’ll be comfortable in all day.<br> 
            Obviously you want to look good, but you’ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.<br></p>
